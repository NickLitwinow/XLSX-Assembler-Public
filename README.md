## Built With

This project was built using these technologies.

- Python
- Airflow
- Cron
- Redis
- Pandas
- Openpyxl
- PyQT5
- Docker

## Features

**üöÄ Efficient ETL Process**

Automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from multiple Excel files using Airflow.\
(Only specific excel structure)

**üìä Advanced Data Processing**

Leverages the power of Pandas and Openpyxl for fast and accurate data reading, processing, and styling.

**üíª Intuitive GUI with PyQt5**

Includes a user-friendly graphical interface for selecting files and tracking real-time progress.

**‚ö° Performance Optimization**

Optimized for reduced system load and faster data processing using Redis, ensuring efficient handling of large datasets.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:
- `Python` and `Docker` installed on your machine

## üõ† Installation and Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/NickLitwinow/XLSXAssembler_Public.git`

2. Navigate into the `src` directory `cd src/`

4. (Terminal 1) Run the ETL client:
`python app.py`

5. (Terminal 2) Build the Docker image (`sudo` may require):
`docker build . --tag extending_airflow:latest`

6. (Terminal 2) Run `docker-compose up -d` command to start docker services.
   
8. (Terminal 2) (Optional) Run `docker-compose down -v` command to end docker services.

The PyQt5 GUI will launch, where you can select multiple Excel files and begin the ETL process.
*Runs the app in the development mode.*

## Usage Instructions Example

1. In the ETL client click `Add File` button and select files from the `example files` (You can add them again later if you want so)
   
2. (Optional) To remove a file from selected, click on it's path (element) in the black selection window. Click `Remove File` to remove the file.
   
3. Click `Merge Files` to name the output file and choose it's destination. The ETL process will start afterwards.
   
4. To view the Airflow Dag process:
- Open `http://localhost:8080/home` in your browser.
- Enter Login: `airflow` and Password: `airflow`.
- (Info) If you just ran the `docker-compose up -d` it may take some time for airflow to load.
   
6. To view the Radis database:
- Open `http://localhost:8001/` in your browser.
- Accept "EULA and Privacy Settings"
- Click `I already have a database`
- Click `Connect to a Radis Database` with Host: `redis`, Port: `6379`, Name: `redis-local`
- Click `ADD REDIS DATABASE`
- Select the `redis-local` database.
